	'Use seasonal ingredients — they cost less and taste better. Plan your menu around what is in season for brighter flavors and lower prices.',
	'Prep ingredients ahead of time. Spend 30–60 minutes once or twice a week to wash, chop and portion vegetables and proteins; you will save time and reduce stress on busy cooking days.',
	'Salt correctly: season throughout the cooking process, not just at the end. Layering salt during cooking builds depth and prevents an under-seasoned final dish.',
	'Use acid to lift flavors. A splash of lemon, vinegar or a spoonful of yogurt added at the end of cooking brightens dishes and balances richness.',
	'Do not overcrowd the pan — give ingredients room to sear. Crowding traps steam and prevents browning, which reduces flavor and texture contrast.',
	'Invest in good knives and keep them sharp. Properly sharpened knives make prep faster, safer and more precise, which improves the final presentation and cooking consistency.',
	'Make a simple flavor base: saut\u00e9 aromatics (onion, garlic, celery, carrot) before adding liquids to create foundational depth in soups, sauces and stews.',
	'Taste as you cook. Adjust seasoning, acidity and fat in small increments; this habit is the fastest route to consistently delicious results.',
